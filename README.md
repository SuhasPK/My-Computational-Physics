## Introduction and Motivation

This repository explores a diverse range of physics and math concepts, focusing on simulations, programs, and $\LaTeX$. Utilizing Python and $\LaTeX$ throughout, my primary motivation was to implement physics and math concepts on a computer after completing relevant Udemy courses and consulting helpful online resources, which are listed at the end.

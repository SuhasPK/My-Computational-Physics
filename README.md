# My-Computational-Physics

## Introduction and Motivation
This repository explore a wide array of physics and math concepts. One key important observation about this repository is, it mainly focuses on physics and math based simulations/programs and also some $\LaTeX$.
The repository majorly uses python, R and $\LaTeX$ from its inception. My main motivation to learn a programming language was to run the concept of physics and math on a computer. And this was possible after going through some udemy courses, some very helpful Youtube channels and blogs/sites, which I will list at the end.

## Projects lists and details

1. Project-1: Series Expansion, Interpolation and Curve fitting
   > This folder consists of python programs on Taylor series, Taylor series expansion, Interpolation, Splines, curve fitting and some error calculations.
3. Project-2: Derivatives
   > This folder consists of taking derivatives of some math functions, central difference method, Richardson's method, and some multi-dimensional derivatives like gradient, divergence and curl.

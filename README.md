## Introduction and Motivation
This repository explore a wide array of physics and math concepts. One key important observation about this repository is, it mainly focuses on physics and math based simulations/programs and also some $\LaTeX$.
The repository majorly uses Python, R and $\LaTeX$ from its inception. My main motivation to learn a programming language was to run the concepts of physics and math on a computer. And this was possible after going through some udemy courses, some very helpful Youtube channels and blogs/sites, which I will list at the end.
